(c)   The winners of the 2002 Christmas Lighting Award Program were in attendance to receive plaques and PUC certificates.  (d)   Tony Martin, M.P.P. Sault Ste. Marie was in attendance concerning Part 2 Young Offenders Unit.  Moved by   Councillor P. Vaudry  Seconded by   Councillor D. Jones  Whereas in 2001 the Province of Ontario announced the closure of the Sault Ste. Marie Jail with over 100 beds because of the age and condition of at least a portion of the facility, opting to build 48 new beds to be attached to the Northern Treatment Centre; and  Whereas, as a result of this announcement a significant number of Provincial civil service jobs will be lost to the community once the new facility opens later in 2003; and  Whereas there will likely be many occasions where adult offenders from Sault Ste. Marie will need to be detained in a facility outside of Sault Ste. Marie because of the smaller number of beds being built; and  Whereas the Provincial Government through the Ministry of Community and Social Services announced in 2001 that it would build a new young offenders open custody facility in Sault Ste. Marie on Second Line across from the Sault Ste.   Marie   Police   Services   building   and   the   property   was   rezoned   for   that purpose by City Council; and 4.   (d)   Whereas the responsibility for young offenders has now been transferred by the Province from the Ministry of Community and Social Services to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security resulting in the new Second Line facility being put on hold pending rationalization of services; and  Whereas the Provincial Government has also recently announced that with the closure of the Sault Ste. Marie Jail it will be closing the Part 2 Young Offenders Unit which is built adjacent to the Sault Ste. Marie Jail and transport young offenders to and from a facility in Sudbury; and  Whereas this announcement by the Provincial Government will result in further significant job losses to Sault Ste. Marie at a time when the community can least afford such losses; and  Whereas the Provincial Government expended approximately $5 million or more in 1986 to build a state of the art and self-contained wing which included an 8 bed Young Offenders Unit and another 54 bed general population secure facility and there is no architectural or engineering reason why the older portion of the Sault Ste. Marie Jail cannot be demolished leaving the new wing to continue to serve Young Offenders; and  Whereas the Province has announced that with the consolidation of Young Offenders to Sudbury with transport from Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins and other facilities; it will require the construction or reconstruction of a new secure facility at Cecil Facer to accommodate the needs of Northern Ontario; and  Whereas such expenditure would be a complete waste of taxpayers money when such a facility already exists in Sault Ste. Marie which could not only look after the secure custody needs of Sault Ste. Marie, but also all of Northern Ontario; and  Whereas   City   Council   is   clearly   on   record,   in   endorsing   its   Economic Diversification Strategy, in fully expecting that the senior levels of government will do their part in helping to stabilize the economy of our community especially in areas where important civic service jobs are at stake; and  Whereas City Council, the City’s Police Chief and the local member of the Provincial legislature are all in agreement that it would be in the best interest of both our community and the Province to decommission the Young Offenders Unit and the new wing of the Sault Ste. Marie Jail, but that all efforts be made to reuse this state of the art facility for all of Northern Ontario; thereby protecting jobs for Sault Ste. Marie and saving significant Provincial tax dollars,  Now therefore be it resolved that this Council requests the Minister of Public Safety and Security to meet immediately with the Mayor and City officials and the City’s member of the Legislature to discuss the best possible action, bearing in mind the needs of both our community and the Province and that no action be taken with respect to the decommissioning of the newest portion of the Sault Ste. Marie Jail until such discussions have been held. CARRIED.  Councillor B. Hayes declared a pecuniary interest - spouse employed by Ministry of Correctional Services. 4.

(s)   Correspondence   from   the   Department   of   Environment,   City   of   Chicago requesting support for a resolution concerning the Great Lakes Protection and Restoration Plan was received by Council.  Mover   Councillor J.Curran  Seconder   Councillor D. Amaroso  Whereas the Great Lakes are the world’s largest source of surface freshwater and are essential to the quality of life and economic vitality of the cities, villages, townships, and counties along the shores and in the surrounding watershed; and  Whereas the Great Lakes support countless recreational, commercial, tourism and   cultural   activities   for   basin   residents   and   visitors;   drive   economic development and improve the economic value of shoreline communities; support critical aquatic and coastal ecosystems; provide fresh drinking water for millions of people; and support agricultural and industrial activities; and  Whereas on a day-to-day basis, the Great Lakes pose challenges - such as fish advisories,   beach   closings,   invasive   species,   stormwater   management   and diminished open space - for mayors, country executives and other municipal leaders; and  Whereas a variety of Great Lakes efforts have been underway for some time, these efforts are not well-coordinated with each other and do not adequately address the long-term protection and restoration of the Great Lakes as a vital resource.   Failure to adequately protect, improve and preserve the Great Lakes could   jeopardize   public   and   environmental   health   as   well   as   the   economic prosperity of all Great Lakes communities; and  Whereas while responsibility for the Great Lakes is shared by two national governments, eight states, two provinces, forty tribes and First Nations, it is municipal leaders who are on the front line, making decisions and investments every day to protect this natural resource; and  Whereas basin-wide protection and restoration are essential to the region’s economy; shipping, tourism and a wealth of other industries depend upon a clean and   sustainable   environment;   enhancing   the   region’s   economic   prospects, therefore, requires aggressive environmental actions; it also demands outreach so that citizens appreciate how their actions affect the Great Lakes; likewise, a clean   and   sustainable   environment   is   possible   only   with   the   ingenuity   and commitment of responsible public and private sectors; and  Whereas although data on some Great Lakes environmental indicators have improved substantially over the past decade, more is needed if actions are to be targeted and effective; Great Lakes municipal leaders must be supported with funding to investigate these scientific challenges, clarify and measure success of projects undertaken and obtain real-time data on which to base daily decisions that affect this water resource; and  Whereas Mayors throughout the Great Lakes region have agreed to establish a Great Lakes Cities Initiative, under which   Mayors and other elected municipal leaders will work jointly to advance the restoration and protection of the Great Lakes ecosystem; and 5.   (s)   Therefore be it resolved that City Council calls upon the U.S. Congress and Canadian   Parliament   to   appropriate   funds   for   the   development,   by   an independent panel of science and policy experts that includes municipal officials, of a detailed plan for Great Lakes protection and restoration; the plan would serve as a blueprint to guide agreed-upon future legislative and appropriations activities that restore and protect the Great Lakes ecosystem.

Marie and area; and  Whereas this request was precipitated by a Provincial announcement that the Sault Ste. Marie Jail, including the newest portion housing the Phase II Young Offenders Unit would be decommissioned and torn down; and  Whereas City officials have met on several occasions with the Deputy Minister and other Ministry officials in the hope of saving badly needed jobs and what appears   to   be   a   perfectly   good   and   useable   $5-7   million   facility   in   our community; and  Whereas   in   spite   of   the   City’s   best   advice,   the   Province   is   nonetheless determined to proceed with its original plans based on the position that it believes it to be the best “business case” for handling the needs of the Algoma District; and  Whereas in addition to the loss of as many as 17 civil service positions, Young Offenders from the Algoma District will be transported to and from and housed in   Sudbury   during   court   processing   and   remand   as   well   as   following incarceration, thereby denying them the requisite rehabilitative support from family and friends in their own community; and  Whereas the city is anxious to prove to the Province that their “business case” makes little sense for either our community or for the Province and that the most effective and efficient way of dealing with our community’s Young Offenders is in our community; and  Whereas the City is not satisfied that the costs to renovate the newest portion of the existing jail is cost prohibitive as suggested by Provincial officials;  Now therefore be it resolved that City Council authorizes an expenditure of no more   than   $30,000.   from   the   $200,000.   fund   which   it   established   in   the Economic Diversification Strategy to lobby and otherwise effectively work with the Province on determining the true cost to renovate the existing jail structure for future Young Offender needs or alternatively to determine the best delivery model which suitably addresses the needs of our community in a cost effective and efficient manner and that appropriate staff report back to Council on a recommended course of action to achieve a reasonable resolve to this important issue.

(a)   Whereas more than 50 percent of a typical Ontario municipality’s budget relates to costs beyond municipal control, including services mandated or controlled by the Provincial government as a result of downloading (e.g., social services, pooling);   the   cost   of   Provincially-mandated   changes   to   service   delivery standards   (e.g.,   Provincial   regulatory   changes   relating   to   drinking   water standards); and general changes in local demographic/economic conditions; and  Whereas   municipalities   have   limited   revenue   sources,   namely   fines,   fees, permits and property taxes while the Provincial government has significant tax sources such as PST, income tax, fuel tax, liquor and cigarette taxes, corporate taxes, and a number of fines, fees and permits; and  Whereas the complexity of the current property tax system and the continuation of mandatory capping already puts residential taxpayers at risk in years when commercial assessment may be declining, and tax ratios are capped; and  Whereas Northern Ontario communities do not enjoy assessment growth which would create new revenue to offset potential tax increases but are experiencing growth decline or are facing negative assessment growth; and  Whereas the cost to hold a referendum will be an additional downloaded burden on the local property taxpayer by the Provincial government; and  Whereas the municipal level of government is the most transparent level of government   in   Canada,   the   majority   of   municipalities   across   Ontario   are accountable and responsible, and have generally for many years held tax increases   to   a   minimum,   and   often   zero;   having   always   justified   any   tax increases to their public in open public sessions of budget discussions as well as every three years during municipal elections; and  Whereas this proposal is yet another example of the imposition by the Province on   municipal   government   of   rules   and   standards   that   the   Province   is   not prepared to impose on itself;  Now therefore be it resolved that the Council of the City of Sault Ste. Marie requests the Provincial government to withdraw the proposed tax referendum legislation   from   its   election   platform   immediately;   and   that   a   copy   of   this resolution be forwarded to local MPP’s, AMO and FONOM.

CARRIED.  (d)   The following Notice of Motion was read at the meeting and will be presented at the 2003 06 23 Council Meeting:  Mover   - Councillor F.
